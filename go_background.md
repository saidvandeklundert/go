Developped at Google by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson.

Created with concurrency and parallelism in mind. It was first released 2012 with three goals in mind:
- efficient compilation
- efficient execution
- ease of programming

The 'why' for Go is described [here](https://golang.org/doc/faq#creating_a_new_language) and the purpose is described [here](https://golang.org/doc/faq#What_is_the_purpose_of_the_project).

Go is good for:
- web services at scale
- networking (HTTP, TCP, UDP)
- concurrency/parallelism
- systems
- automation/command line tools


Guiding principles of the Go design:
- expressive, comprehensible, sophisticated
- clean, clear, easy to read
